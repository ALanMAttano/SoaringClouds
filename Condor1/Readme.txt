Installation Instructions


Essentially, to let Soaring Clouds work, you need to copy the .tga cirrus and cloud textures (and if you wish the SoaringClouds.txt) to the Condor "Clouds" folder. Do not replace the folders. Just copy and paste the files. Here full explanation in 3 steps.

1) BACKUP
Open the file explorer and go to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Condor\World
Back up by making a copy of the "Clouds" folder and place it in a secure place.

2) DOWNLOAD
Download and uncompress or unzip the SoaringClouds file.
Go to:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zP6d8DDyY4YM-ppAdg1dv2u4ifNUtfNQ?usp=sharing
And download the latest "SoaringClouds 512" Congestus version.
The file is compressed (zipped). Unzipped:
Right-click on the .zip file and click "Extract All..." anywhere.

3) REPLACE
Select all the files that are inside the folder "512 Congestus".
Do not change the name form "512 Congestus" to "Clouds"
Select the content .tga and .txt files that are inside the uncompressed:
SoaringClouds\512 Congestus
And drag and drop them (+ control) or make a copy and paste them into the Condor1 "Clouds" folder, located:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Condor\World\Clouds
The "Soaring Clouds.txt" is not necessary but helps you to remember.

That's all.
