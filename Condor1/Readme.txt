SoringClouds for Condor1
Alan Mattano 2020 SoaringStarsLab


Installation Instructions


So essentially, to let Soaring Clouds work, you need to copy the .tga texures (and if you wish the readme.txt) to the Condor "Clouds" folder.

BACKUP
Open the file explorer and go to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Condor\World
Back up by making a copy of the "Clouds" folder.

DOWNLOAD
Download and uncompress or unzip the SoaringClouds file. 
Go to:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zP6d8DDyY4YM-ppAdg1dv2u4ifNUtfNQ?usp=sharing
And download the latest "SoaringClouds 512" Congestus version.
The file is compressed (zipped). Unzipped:
Right-click on the .zip file and click "Extract All..." anywhere.

CONDOR
Select all the files that are inside the folder "512 Congestus".
These .tga and .txt files that are inside the uncompressed:
SoaringClouds\512 Congestus
And drag and drop them (+ shift for making a copy and not moving them) into the Condor1 cloud folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Condor\World\Clouds

That's all.
